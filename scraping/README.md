You'll have to get the input file yourself, from (here)[https://github.com/ZeoVan/MSR_20_Code_Vulnerability_CSV_Dataset/blob/master/all_c_cpp_release2.0.csv]. 

You can run `demo.py` yourself, but if you're having any issues use the docker version.

# Running - Docker

```sh
docker-compose run --rm app
```

This will give you an environment where you can run the code.

Any edits you make to the folder on your machine will be reflected instantly in the terminal environment.

# Demo

Check the demo.py file for the example code.
