Explanation:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to CWE-91, also known as XML Injection (Blind XPath Injection). This vulnerability occurs when untrusted user input is concatenated directly into an XPath query without proper sanitization. In this case, the `country` parameter is directly concatenated into the XPath query without validation or sanitization.

Exploitation:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `country` parameter to inject malicious XPath expressions. For example, if the attacker provides a malicious input like `'; DROP TABLE users --`, the XPath query would become:
`/travel_stories/user[@country=''; DROP TABLE users --']/story/text()`

If the vulnerable code executes this modified XPath query, it could result in unintended behavior such as data leakage, data modification, or even data deletion.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, you should never directly concatenate user input into XPath queries. Instead, use parameterized queries or validation to ensure that user input is safe to use in XPath queries. Additionally, consider using a safer data format like JSON to store and retrieve data rather than XML, as JSON is less prone to injection vulnerabilities.
