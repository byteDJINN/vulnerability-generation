Explanation:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to CRLF Injection because the `$description` variable coming from user input is directly interpolated into the SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inserting CRLF sequences, which are special characters represented as `\r\n` in the user input. This could allow the attacker to manipulate the SQL query to perform unauthorized actions such as injecting additional SQL statements or modifying existing queries.

To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize and properly escape user input before incorporating it into SQL queries. One way to mitigate the CRLF Injection vulnerability is by using prepared statements and parameterized queries. This approach ensures that user input is treated as data rather than executable code, thereby preventing malicious injections. Additionally, input validation and filtering can help to restrict the types of characters allowed in the user input to prevent CRLF Injection attacks.
