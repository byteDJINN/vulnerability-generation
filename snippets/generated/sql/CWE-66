SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE filename = 'recipes.jpg'

/*"""DELIMITER
```
|CODE|```

**Vulnerability Explanation:**
The SQL code snippet above is vulnerable to CWE-66, which is the improper handling of file names that identify virtual resources. In this case, the SQL query is fetching data from a database table based on a filename parameter without proper input validation or sanitization.

**Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the filename parameter to inject malicious code such as SQL injection queries. For example, by passing in a value like `' OR 1=1 --`, an attacker could manipulate the SQL query to return all records from the `recipes` table regardless of the filename.

**Fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to use parameterized queries or input validation to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. By using parameterized queries with placeholders for dynamic values, the database driver ensures that the input is treated only as data and not as executable SQL code. This eliminates the risk of SQL injection attacks and properly handles file names that identify virtual resources.
