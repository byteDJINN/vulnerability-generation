rm -rf /path/to/data/${moment}.txt

|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code snippet above is due to the lack of input validation on the "moment" variable, making it vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78). An attacker can inject malicious commands to be executed on the system, leading to unauthorized operations like deleting files.

Exploitation:
An attacker can input a malicious payload such as:
```
; rm -rf /
```
The payload added after the semicolon will be executed as a separate command, leading to the deletion of important system files and directories.

Fix:
To fix the vulnerability, always validate and sanitize user inputs, especially when constructing and executing operating system commands. One way to mitigate this issue is to use proper input validation and sanitization techniques, such as restricting input to specific characters or using parameterized commands instead of directly concatenating user input into commands. In this case, using proper quoting and parameterization with shell commands like `echo` can help prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
