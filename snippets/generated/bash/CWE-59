|CODE|```

In the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is in the `feed_pet` function where user input (`$pet_name`) is directly concatenated to the variable storing the path to the virtual pet file (`$virtual_pet`) without proper validation. This vulnerability allows an attacker to control the file path that is being accessed, leading to a potential Directory Traversal attack.

Exploitation:
An attacker can input a malicious file path or use relative path traversal sequences like "../" to access sensitive files on the system. For example, if the attacker inputs "../../../../etc/passwd" as the virtual pet's name, the script would attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file on the system.

Fix:
To fix the vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented before using user-controlled data as file paths. One way to mitigate this vulnerability is to enforce strict validation on the input to ensure that it only contains allowed characters and does not contain any directory traversal sequences. Additionally, using absolute file paths instead of relative paths can help prevent such attacks.
