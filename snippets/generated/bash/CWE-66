|CODE|```

In the code snippet above, the vulnerability is the improper handling of user input stored in the `$user_input` variable without proper validation. This vulnerability could lead to a path traversal attack where an attacker crafts a malicious input that contains special characters or sequences to navigate to sensitive files on the server. In this case, an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability by inputting something like "../.bashrc" as the value of `$user_input` to access files outside of the intended directory, such as the `.bashrc` file which may contain sensitive information.

To fix the vulnerability, you should sanitize and validate user input properly before using it to construct file paths, such as restricting input to known safe characters or whitelist input validation. Additionally, it's important to use absolute file paths instead of concatenating user input directly into the path to prevent path traversal attacks.
