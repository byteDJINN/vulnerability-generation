|CODE|``` 

In this code snippet, the vulnerability lies in the `proposal_details` variable, which is directly being passed to the `bash` command without proper validation or sanitization. This could enable an attacker to inject malicious commands into the `proposal_details` input, resulting in code injection.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious input when prompted for the grant proposal details. For example, an attacker could craft a proposal with the following content: `echo "Malicious code executed!"`.

To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented before executing the `bash` command. One way to mitigate this issue is to use strict data validation to ensure that the input contains only allowed characters and does not include any special characters or commands. Additionally, considering alternative methods for handling the input without resorting to executing arbitrary commands directly would be a more secure approach.
