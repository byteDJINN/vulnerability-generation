### Vulnerability Description:
The code snippet contains a vulnerability known as CWE-93 "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')". In this context, CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences are improperly handled within the user inputs. 

### How the Vulnerability Works:
An attacker could craft a malicious input value for either $item_name or $seller_name that includes CRLF characters. These characters could be used to manipulate the output generated by the echo commands, potentially allowing an attacker to insert additional content or malicious scripts into the output.

### How It Could Be Exploited:
By injecting CRLF characters into the item_name or seller_name inputs, an attacker could potentially insert fake messages, alter the appearance of the output, or even inject malicious scripts that could be executed by unsuspecting users viewing the website.

### How to Fix the Vulnerability:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's essential to sanitize user inputs by properly encoding or filtering out special characters like CRLF sequences. One way to address this is by using input validation functions or libraries to ensure that user inputs do not contain any harmful characters before using them in commands like `echo`. Additionally, using appropriate Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and proper output encoding can also help prevent such attacks.
