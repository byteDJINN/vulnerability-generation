Explanation:
This Bash code snippet is vulnerable to Path Traversal (CWE-22) because it allows the user to input a file name that might contain "../" sequences to navigate outside the intended directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a file name like "../../etc/passwd" to read sensitive system files outside of the designated directory.

To fix this vulnerability, you should implement proper input validation by restricting the user input to only valid characters or file names within the legitimate directory structure. One way to do this is by checking if the file name contains any ".." sequences or special characters before proceeding with the file operation. Additionally, consider using absolute file paths instead of relative paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
