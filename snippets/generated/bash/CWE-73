**Vulnerability Explanation:**
The vulnerability in the code snippet is due to the fact that the script allows user input to directly influence the file path where the file is being copied. This can potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the input and gain unauthorized access to sensitive files on the system or overwrite system files.

**Exploitation:**
An attacker could provide input such as "../../some_sensitive_file" as the filename input. This would result in the script copying the file to a location outside the intended directory, potentially revealing sensitive information or causing unintended consequences.

**Fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented to ensure that the filename provided by the user does not allow any path traversal or unauthorized access. One way to do this is to check if the filename contains any special characters or directory traversal sequences before allowing the file copy operation to take place. Additionally, limiting the file copy operation to a specific directory can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.
