### Vulnerability Explanation:
The vulnerability in this code snippet is CWE-117 "Improper Output Neutralization for Logs". This vulnerability occurs when user-controlled data is included in log entries without proper sanitization, allowing malicious users to inject malicious code or special characters into the log entries.

### Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious input into the `$currentUser` variable, which would then be included in the log entry written to the log file. For example, an attacker could craft a username containing special characters or commands that could modify or corrupt the log file, or execute arbitrary commands on the system.

### Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and proper output neutralization should be applied before including user-controlled data in log entries. This can be achieved by using functions like `Remove-Item` or `Remove-ItemProperty` from PowerShell to sanitize the input and remove any potentially harmful characters before writing the log entry. Additionally, it is recommended to log only necessary information and avoid logging sensitive data.
