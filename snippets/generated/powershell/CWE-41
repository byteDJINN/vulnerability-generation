### Vulnerability Explanation:
The vulnerability in the above code snippet is related to improper resolution of file path equivalence (CWE-41). In this case, the code snippet uses the `-like` operator to check if the user input path starts with the specified file path (`$filePath`). This could potentially lead to path traversal attacks if not handled correctly.

### Exploitation:
An attacker could input a path like `"C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\..\Windows\System32\somefile.txt"` which would resolve to `C:\Users\Administrator\Windows\System32\somefile.txt`. This allows the attacker to access files outside of the intended directory (`Desktop`) and potentially overwrite system files.

### Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use absolute paths and validate user input thoroughly. Implement proper input validation by checking if the user input path is a valid and allowed path before performing any file operations. Use built-in functions like `Resolve-Path` in PowerShell to get the absolute path and compare it with the allowed directory paths.
