Explanation of the vulnerability:
The vulnerability in the code snippet above is CWE-76 "Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements". This vulnerability arises from improper filtering or sanitization of user input, which can allow attackers to inject malicious code or tags into the system. In this case, the script is trying to remove any HTML tags from the user input using regular expressions, but the regular expression `"<.*?>"` is not sufficient to properly neutralize all special HTML characters.

How it could be exploited:
An attacker could input a malicious string like `<script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>` as their selected dish, which would not be properly sanitized by the regular expression used in the code snippet. As a result, the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tags would be executed when the user input is displayed back to the user, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

How to fix the vulnerability:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a more robust HTML encoding library or function provided by PowerShell to properly strip out or encode all special HTML characters. Alternatively, strictly limit user input to only alphanumeric characters or a predefined list of allowed characters to prevent injection attacks.
