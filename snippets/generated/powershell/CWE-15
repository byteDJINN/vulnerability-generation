### Vulnerability Explanation:
The vulnerability in the provided code snippet is CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting". In this case, the user can input any plant name, which is directly used to construct a URL to download an image from a remote server without proper validation. This allows an attacker to potentially control or influence which URLs are used in the code execution.

### How It Could Be Exploited:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious plant name that points to a URL under their control containing malicious content, such as malware or phishing attacks. This could lead to the unintentional download and execution of harmful files on the user's system.

### How to Fix:
To mitigate this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be performed before using user-controlled data to construct URLs or make external requests. Specifically, restrict the input to a pre-defined list of plant names or whitelist allowed characters to prevent attackers from injecting malicious URLs. Additionally, consider using secure and direct URL references to trusted sources instead of constructing URLs from user input.
