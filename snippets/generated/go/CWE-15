Explanation:
In the code snippet provided, there is a vulnerability related to CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting". This vulnerability arises from the fact that the `updatePlantWateringSchedule` function relies on user input (`plantName`) directly from the URL query parameter without proper validation or sanitization.

How it could be exploited:
An attacker could maliciously craft a request with a specially crafted plantName parameter containing unexpected characters or commands, leading to unintended behavior or potentially harmful operations being performed on the system. For example, an attacker could inject shell commands as part of the plantName parameter and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.

How to fix the vulnerability:
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that user input is properly validated, sanitized, and constrained before using it in sensitive operations like system calls or configurations. In this case, you should validate the plantName parameter to ensure it only contains allowed characters and does not allow for injection attacks. It is recommended to enforce strict input validation and sanitization practices to prevent external control of system configurations or settings.
