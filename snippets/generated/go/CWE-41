|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability in this code snippet lies in the `handleFileServe` function where the file path is constructed by concatenating a user-controlled input `filename` to the base path "./user_files/". An attacker could manipulate the "filename" parameter in the URL to navigate to arbitrary files on the server's file system. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive files, such as configuration files, that should not be publicly accessible.

Exploitation:
An attacker could craft a URL like http://example.com/file?filename=../../../../../etc/passwd to try to access the server's password file. If the server allows such path traversal, the attacker could potentially read the contents of the password file.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to perform proper input validation and sanitization on user-controlled inputs before constructing file paths. One way to mitigate this issue is to check if the provided `filename` is within an allowed directory and restrict access to only permitted files. Furthermore, consider renaming or obfuscating sensitive files and directories to make it harder for an attacker to guess the paths.
