Explanation of vulnerability (CWE-15 - External Control of System or Configuration Setting):  
In this code snippet, the application reads a configuration file `config.json` from the file system using the `fs.readFile` method. It then parses the content of the configuration file to access a specific configuration setting (`enableDebugMode`). However, this creates a vulnerability as an attacker can potentially modify the `config.json` file to set `enableDebugMode` to true, allowing them to execute malicious code by taking advantage of the debug mode.

How it could be exploited:  
An attacker could manipulate the `config.json` file to set `enableDebugMode` to true, potentially exposing sensitive information, executing arbitrary code, or gaining unauthorized access to the application's functionality.

How it could be fixed:  
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to avoid directly reading configuration settings from an external file without proper validation. Instead, configuration settings should be stored securely on the server side and only accessed through properly secured endpoints. Additionally, sensitive configuration settings should not be controlled by user input, and access to debug mode settings should be restricted and carefully managed.
