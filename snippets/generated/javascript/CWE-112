|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code snippet is CWE-112 "Missing XML Validation". The code reads XML data from a file without validating its content, making it susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious XML file that contains an external entity reference pointing to sensitive files on the server, such as /etc/passwd, and sending it to the application. When the application processes this XML file, it will inadvertently disclose the contents of the sensitive file to the attacker.

To fix this vulnerability, it is important to implement input validation and sanitize any user-provided XML data before parsing it. One way to mitigate XXE attacks is to disable external entity resolution during XML parsing or use a secure XML parsing library that handles XXE prevention, like xml2js.

Remember to always validate and sanitize user input, especially when dealing with potentially dangerous file formats like XML.
