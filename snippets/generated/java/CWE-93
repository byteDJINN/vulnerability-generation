Explanation of the vulnerability (CWE-93 - Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection')):
The vulnerability in this code snippet is due to the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input. The `addListing` method concatenates the `itemTitle`, `itemDescription`, and `sellerName` strings without validating or sanitizing them. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequences into the input parameters, potentially allowing them to add malicious content to the listing details.

How it could be exploited:
An attacker could craft a malicious request by adding CRLF sequences in the input fields. For example, they could set the `itemTitle` to the following value:
"Malicious Item%nContent-Type: text/html%n%n<h1>Malicious Content</h1>"

When the `listingDetails` concatenation occurs, the CRLF sequences (%n) would create new lines in the output, potentially leading to unexpected behavior like injecting HTML content or manipulating the response headers.

How to fix the vulnerability:
To mitigate the CRLF injection vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented. Specifically, the input parameters (`itemTitle`, `itemDescription`, `sellerName`) should be properly sanitized to prevent the injection of newline characters or other special characters. One way to address this issue is by using a white-list approach where only specific characters are allowed in the input fields. Additionally, escaping or encoding user input before concatenation can help prevent unintended injections. In this case, using methods like `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml` or input validation libraries can help sanitize the user input before processing it further.
