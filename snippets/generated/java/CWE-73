#### Vulnerability Explanation:
The code snippet above contains the vulnerability `CWE-73 External Control of File Name or Path`. This vulnerability arises when the code doesn't properly validate and sanitize user input that specifies a file name or file path. In this case, the `createFile` method allows the user to specify the file name to be created without proper validation.

#### How it could be exploited:
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious file name or path when running the `main` method. This could lead to unintended files being created, overwriting sensitive files, or even executing arbitrary code if the file path includes executable commands.

#### How to fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it's important to validate and sanitize user input when specifying file names or paths. Use predefined file paths or restrict file names to a certain format to prevent potential attacks. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach where only known safe inputs are accepted. Alternatively, you can generate unique file names internally rather than relying on user input.
