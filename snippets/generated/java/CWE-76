### Vulnerability Explanation:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to CWE-76, which is Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements. This vulnerability arises when user input is not properly sanitized and directly included in an HTML response. In this case, the `userSelection` input is directly concatenated into the `html` string without any validation or sanitization.

### How it could be exploited:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the `userSelection` input. For example, they could input `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as `userSelection`, causing a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack when the `displayBuffetMenu` method is called and the HTML response is generated.

### How to fix it:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and proper output encoding should be implemented. User input should be sanitized to remove any HTML or JavaScript code before including it in the HTML response. One way to sanitize input is by using libraries like OWASP Java Encoder to encode the user input before incorporating it into HTML. For example, `ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML(userSelection)` can be used to encode the input and prevent XSS attacks. It is important to always validate and sanitize user input to prevent such security vulnerabilities.
