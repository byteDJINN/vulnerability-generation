In the provided code snippet, the vulnerability CWE-59 "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')" is present. This vulnerability arises when file paths are constructed using input from external sources without properly validating or sanitizing that input. In this case, the `petName` provided by the user is directly concatenated with the `PETS_DIRECTORY` path to form the file path.

Exploitation:
An attacker could manipulate the `petName` input to traverse to directories outside the intended `PETS_DIRECTORY`, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive system files.

Mitigation:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization techniques should be employed to ensure that the `petName` input does not contain any path traversal sequences (such as "../"). Additionally, a whitelist approach can be used to restrict input to a predefined set of allowed values (e.g., valid pet names). Sanitizing user input before using it to construct file paths is essential to prevent path traversal attacks.
