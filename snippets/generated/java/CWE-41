|CODE|```

This code snippet contains the vulnerability CWE-41 "Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence". The vulnerability allows an attacker to access or manipulate files that should not be accessible by navigating through the file system.

In this case, the vulnerability arises from concatenating the `basePath` and `fileName` strings without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to potentially escape the intended directory and access sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`.

Exploiting this vulnerability involves crafting a malicious `fileName` that includes sufficient `../` sequences to traverse out of the intended directory (in this case, "../../../../../etc/passwd").

To fix this vulnerability, it's important to sanitize user inputs and validate file paths to ensure that they don't allow path traversal. One way to mitigate this vulnerability is by using a file path normalization function to resolve and check the final path against a whitelist of permitted directories before accessing the file. Additionally, consider using secure coding practices and tools to prevent path traversal attacks.
