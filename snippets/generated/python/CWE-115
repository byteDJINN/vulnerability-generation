# This code snippet reads user input for mood and interests to generate a playlist

|CODE|```

This code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-115 "Misinterpretation of Input" because it directly reads user inputs for mood and interests without any input validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input such as SQL injections, XSS attacks, or other forms of attacks through the user input fields.

To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented. For example, limiting the input length, validating the input format, and escaping/encoding special characters can help prevent common exploitation techniques. Use libraries or frameworks that provide protection against common attacks to ensure the security of the website.
