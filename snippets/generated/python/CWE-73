|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability in the above code snippet is CWE-73 "External Control of File Name or Path". In this snippet, the `file_path` variable is being constructed by concatenating the user input `file_name` with the fixed path `"/path/to/save/files/"`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `file_name` input and potentially write files to unintended locations on the server.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious file name that includes path traversal characters like "../" to navigate to sensitive directories on the server and potentially overwrite important files or execute arbitrary code.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, you should avoid concatenating user input directly with a fixed path when constructing file paths. Instead, sanitize the user input by validating and restricting the characters that are allowed in the file name. Use a whitelist approach to only allow specific characters or patterns in the file name input. Additionally, consider using a library like `os.path` to safely join the file path components.
