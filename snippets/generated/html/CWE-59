**Vulnerability Explanation:**
The vulnerability in this code snippet is CWE-59 (Improper Link Resolution Before File Access), also known as "Link Following." By linking directly to a local file (in this case, "C:/important-file.txt"), an attacker can trick a user into navigating to a potentially malicious file on the user's system. This can lead to sensitive data exposure or execution of malicious code.

**Exploitation:**
An attacker could craft a phishing email pretending to be from the website, enticing users to click on the link to "feed their virtual pet." If a user clicks on the link, it will attempt to access the local file "C:/important-file.txt," which could contain sensitive information. The attacker could potentially access this file or use it to further compromise the user's system.

**Fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, links should not directly reference local files using the `file:///` protocol. Instead, all links should point to legitimate URLs on the server side. If local file access is required, it should be properly controlled and secured, and access should be restricted to authorized users only. Regular security assessments and input validation can also help prevent such vulnerabilities.
