Explanation:

Vulnerability: CWE-112 "Missing XML Validation"
How the vulnerability works: In the provided code snippet, the form sends user input to a PHP script `processRequest.php` without validating or sanitizing the input data. This lack of validation opens up the possibility for an attacker to send malicious XML data that could exploit vulnerabilities in the processing script.

Exploitation: An attacker could craft malicious XML data to execute various attacks such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML injection attacks, or other types of malicious XML payloads that could lead to data leaks, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or denial of service (DoS) attacks.

Solution: To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented. Specifically, if the input is intended to be XML data, the server-side script should validate the XML data structure, sanitize input to remove any potentially harmful content, and only process trusted XML content. Additionally, limiting the size and complexity of XML data accepted can also help mitigate some risks associated with malicious XML payloads. Using XML parsers that disable external entity processing by default is also recommended to prevent XXE attacks.
