Explanation:
In the code snippet provided, the vulnerability CWE-76 "Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements" is present due to the lack of input validation when echoing user input ($_GET["user_input"]) directly onto the webpage using `document.write()`. This can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack where an attacker could inject malicious code into the webpage, which would then be executed in the context of other users accessing the page.

Exploitation:
An attacker could craft a specially crafted URL with a malicious script payload as the value for the "user_input" parameter. When a victim accesses this URL, the script would be executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or deface the website.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and output encoding should be applied to prevent the execution of arbitrary scripts. You should sanitize and validate all user inputs before echoing them onto the webpage. Use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` or `encodeURIComponent()` to encode user input, which will neutralize any special characters and prevent XSS attacks.
