|CODE|```

**Explanation:**
The vulnerability in this code snippet is the Blind XPath Injection, specifically CWE-91. This vulnerability arises from the direct concatenation of user input (`$country`) into an XML structure without proper sanitization or validation.

**How it could be exploited:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a maliciously crafted input in the "Enter Country" field, such as `']</country><country>`, which could lead to XPath Injection. This could potentially modify the XML structure of the query and possibly execute unintended commands.

**How it could be fixed:**
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented to ensure that the input `$country` does not contain any harmful characters or sequences that could alter the XML structure. One way to prevent XPath Injection is by using parameterized XPath queries or by properly escaping user input before inserting it into the query.
