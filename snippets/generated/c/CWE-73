Explanation:
The code snippet above contains the vulnerability CWE-73 "External Control of File Name or Path" because it allows an attacker to manipulate the input provided for the file name, leading to potential security risks. In this case, an attacker could enter a malicious file path instead of a legitimate file, causing the program to access unintended files on the system.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a file name that contains special characters or relative/absolute paths to access sensitive files on the system. For instance, an attacker could input "../credentials.txt" to access a file containing sensitive information.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize user input and validate the file name provided by the user to ensure it is within a predefined scope or whitelist of allowed files. Limiting the file paths to a specific directory or using secure functions like `fopen_s` in C can help mitigate this vulnerability. Additionally, implementing proper input validation and error handling can enhance the security of the file operations in the code.
