Explanation of vulnerability:
The vulnerability in this code snippet is that the user input (local tips) provided through the `fgets` function is directly passed to the `fprintf` function without proper sanitization or neutralization. This means that an attacker could potentially inject format specifiers into the input, leading to a format string vulnerability. 

How it could be exploited:
An attacker could craft a malicious input containing format specifiers such as `%s`, `%x`, etc., which could lead to information disclosure or even arbitrary code execution. For example, an attacker could input `%x %x %x` which might leak stack memory contents.

How to fix the vulnerability:
To fix this vulnerability, it is important to properly neutralize the user input before passing it to the `fprintf` function. This can be achieved by using format specifiers with `printf`-style formatting, such as `%s`, to ensure that the input is treated as a string rather than a format specifier. Additionally, input validation and sanitization should be performed to detect and discard any potentially malicious input.
