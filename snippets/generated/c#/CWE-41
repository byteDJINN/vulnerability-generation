In the provided code snippet, the vulnerability CWE-41 "Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence" exists. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory by manipulating file paths. 

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a carefully crafted file path in the `fileName` variable that includes directory traversal characters like "../" to navigate to sensitive system files such as password files.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a safe and reliable method for constructing file paths, such as `Path.Combine()` which handles directory traversal characters and ensures the constructed path does not navigate outside the intended directory. Here's the fixed code snippet using `Path.Combine()`:

```csharp
string basePath = "C:\\Artisans\\";
string fileName = "..\\Passwords\\password.txt";
string fullPath = Path.Combine(basePath, fileName);

// Read file at fullPath
File.ReadAllLines(fullPath);
```

By using `Path.Combine()`, the code ensures that the resulting path is always valid and restricts access to files outside the intended directory, preventing directory traversal attacks.
