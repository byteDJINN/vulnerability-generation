<?php
$file = $_GET['file'];
include('/var/www/' . $file);

/*"""DELIMITER
```php
|CODE|```

The vulnerability in the code snippet is due to the direct use of user input ($_GET['file']) to construct a file path for including external files. This can allow an attacker to specify a malicious file as the input, and if the file is included without proper validation, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing a malicious file path as a parameter in the URL. For example:
```
http://website.com/vulnerable.php?file=malicious-file.php
```
If the server processes this request without proper validation, it will include the malicious file "malicious-file.php" in the response, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the server environment.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them to include or access files. One approach could be to maintain a whitelist of allowed files and only include files that are on the whitelist. Additionally, avoid directly including user-provided input and use alternative methods to fetch files if required, such as using databases to store filenames and fetching them securely.
