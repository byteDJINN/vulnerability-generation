In the provided code snippet, the vulnerability CWE-59 "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')" can be found. This vulnerability arises when user input is used directly to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. In this case, the `$petId` value from the `$_GET` superglobal is used to construct the file path without any validation.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `$petId` value in the URL to access arbitrary files on the server. For example, an attacker could pass `../../../../../etc/passwd` as the `id` parameter value to navigate to sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd` and potentially retrieve confidential information.

To fix this vulnerability, you should never directly use user input to construct file paths. Instead, you should validate and sanitize the input before using it. One approach to mitigate this vulnerability is to maintain a mapping of valid pet IDs and their corresponding files in a safe manner. Additionally, you can use whitelisting techniques to restrict the allowed characters in the `$petId` input, ensuring it only contains alphanumeric characters or a specific format.
