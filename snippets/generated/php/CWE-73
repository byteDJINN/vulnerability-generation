|CODE|```

Explanation:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to CWE-73 "External Control of File Name or Path" because it directly uses user input ($_GET['file']) to construct a file path without any validation or sanitization. An attacker can provide a malicious file path as a query parameter value, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary files on the server.

Exploitation:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'file' parameter in the URL to point to sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, database files, or PHP scripts containing sensitive information. By including such files, the attacker may be able to access or modify critical data, execute arbitrary code, or perform other malicious actions on the server.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, you should never directly use user input to construct file paths for file inclusion. Instead, validate and sanitize the user input to ensure it points to a legitimate file within an allowed directory. Also, consider storing files outside of the webroot and implementing access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files.
