|CODE|```

Explanation:
The code snippet above reads a configuration file from the user input ($_GET['config']), making it vulnerable to CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting". An attacker could manipulate the value of 'config' parameter in the URL to access sensitive system files or change critical settings, leading to potential security breaches or unauthorized access.

Exploitation:
An attacker could craft a malicious URL like `http://example.com/vulnerable.php?config=/path/to/sensitive/file` to read sensitive information or modify system configurations. For example, an attacker could try to access the 'passwd' file (/etc/passwd) to retrieve user credentials or inject malicious code into the configuration files to compromise the system.

Fix:
To prevent CWE-15 vulnerability, never directly use user-controlled input to access system files or configurations. Instead, validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them. In this case, you can restrict the allowed configuration files to be accessed or use a predefined list of configuration files within the application to avoid external control. Additionally, limit the file permissions to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive files.
