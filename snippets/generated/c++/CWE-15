Explanation:
This code snippet contains the vulnerability CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting". In this snippet, the user input for the plant name is directly written to a file named "plants.txt" using `std::ofstream`. After writing the user input, the code then uses the `system` function to echo a message into the same "plants.txt" file.

This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious user by providing input that includes special characters or shell commands. For example, if a user enters a plant name like `'; rm -rf /;'`, it could lead to unexpected behavior like deleting all files in the system.

To fix this vulnerability, user input should be sanitized and validated before writing it to the file or executing with system commands. Use functions like `std::getline` to read user input and ensure it does not contain any malicious characters or commands before processing it. Additionally, avoid using the `system` function to execute shell commands and consider using more secure alternatives like `std::system` or subprocess libraries.
