|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability in this code snippet is the improper handling of file paths. The program allows users to input a file name, and then appends the user input directly to the path "orders/" to try to open the file. This is dangerous because an attacker could provide a malicious file path that includes characters like "../" to navigate outside of the intended directory and access sensitive files on the server.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a user input like "../../../etc/passwd", which would allow them to read the system's password file and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize the user input before using it to construct the file path. One approach is to use a whitelist of acceptable characters and verify that the user input only contains valid characters. Additionally, consider using absolute file paths instead of relative ones to prevent path traversal attacks.
