Explanation of vulnerability:

The vulnerability in the code snippet is CWE-93, also known as CRLF Injection. In this snippet, the program prompts the user to enter a comment, which is stored in the `comment` variable. However, the program does not properly sanitize user input, making it susceptible to CRLF injection.

CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection occurs when an attacker can insert additional headers or new lines by using special characters like `\r` (carriage return) and `\n` (line feed). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a comment along with CRLF characters to inject additional content into the output, potentially causing malicious behavior like altering the response headers, injecting malicious scripts, or even performing phishing attacks.

How to exploit:
1. Enter a comment like: `Nice website!\r\nLocation: Attacker-Controlled-Site\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<html>Malicious content here</html>`
2. The injected CRLF characters would create new lines and potentially add malicious content to the output.
3. This could trick users into visiting the attacker-controlled site or executing malicious scripts included in the injected content.

How to fix:
1. Sanitize user input by validating and filtering out any CRLF characters.
2. Ensure that user input is properly escaped before displaying or using it in any context, especially in HTTP responses.
3. Use functions like `std::getline` responsibly, ensuring that it reads input properly without including unwanted characters.

In the code snippet, the vulnerability can be fixed by checking the user input for CRLF characters and removing or escaping them before storing or displaying it.
