### Explanation
The vulnerability in the code snippet above is related to CWE-15: External Control of System or Configuration Setting. This vulnerability arises from using user input (`req.query.templateFile`) directly in a critical function without proper validation or sanitization. In this case, the input is used to construct a file path (`/templates/${fileName}`) which is then passed to `fs.readFile`. This makes the application vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.

### Exploitation
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a request with a `templateFile` parameter designed to traverse directories. For example, requesting a URL like `/load-design?templateFile=../../config/passwd` could allow the attacker to read files outside of the intended `/templates` directory, potentially accessing sensitive files on the server.

### Fix
To fix this vulnerability, the application should validate and sanitize input used in file paths or any system configuration setting. Here's an improved version:

```typescript
app.get('/load-design', (req, res) => {
  let fileName = req.query.templateFile;
  
  // Add validation to ensure the fileName is within the expected scope
  if (!fileName.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+.json$/)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid file name.');
  }
  
  fs.readFile(`/templates/${fileName}`, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).send('Error loading your design template.');
    }
    return res.send(data);
  });
});
```

This version restricts which files can be read to those matching a basic pattern `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+.json`, effectively preventing directory traversal attacks by ensuring that only JSON files with names consisting of alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dashes can be accessed. Always remember, validating and sanitizing user inputs are crucial steps in securing applications from various forms of attacks.
