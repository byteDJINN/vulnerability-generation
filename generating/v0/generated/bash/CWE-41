**Explanation of Vulnerability (CWE-41):**
The vulnerability in the code snippet is the improper resolution of the file path provided by the user. The user input `file_path` is directly used in the `cat` command without proper validation or sanitization. This can potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the path and access unintended files on the system. By providing a malicious file path (e.g., "../../etc/passwd"), an attacker may be able to read sensitive files or perform other unauthorized actions.

**Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted file path that includes relative path traversal sequences like "../" to navigate to directories outside of the intended scope. This could allow the attacker to access confidential files or overwrite system files, leading to unauthorized data exposure or system compromise.

**Fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, it is important to properly sanitize and validate user input for file paths. One way to mitigate this vulnerability is to use absolute file paths or limit the user input to a specific directory or whitelist of allowed file paths. Additionally, input validation checks should be performed to ensure that the file path provided by the user is within the expected directory structure. Implementing proper input validation and output encoding can help prevent path traversal attacks and enhance the overall security of the application.
