**Explanation:**
In the code snippet provided, there is a vulnerability known as CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting". This vulnerability arises when the application allows an attacker to influence or manipulate the settings, system behavior, or configurations of the application.

**How it could be exploited:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inputting malicious commands disguised as the name of a plant. In this case, the script takes user input for the plant name and directly inserts it into a command that removes the directory related to the plant. An attacker could provide a malicious plant name like `"; echo HACKED; rm -rf /"`, which will be executed by the `sudo rm -rf /plants/$plant_name` command, leading to the deletion of critical files on the system.

**How to fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, you should never execute user-provided input as a command directly. Instead, validate and sanitize user input before using it in commands to ensure it does not contain any malicious commands. In this case, you could validate the plant name input to ensure it only contains alphanumeric characters and allowed symbols for plant names before using it in the `rm` command. Additionally, consider using safer alternatives like whitelisting allowed plant names or performing input validation and escaping user-provided input before using it in system commands.
