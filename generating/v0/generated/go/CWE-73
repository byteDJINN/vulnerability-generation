Explanation:
The provided code snippet contains a vulnerability known as CWE-73, which is "External Control of File Name or Path". This vulnerability arises when the code allows an external entity to control a file name or file path, potentially leading to arbitrary file access and manipulation by attackers.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious file name as a command-line argument, allowing them to access sensitive system files, modify existing files, or even upload malicious files to the system.

Fix:
To fix the vulnerability, it is essential to validate the file name or path provided by the user and ensure that it cannot be controlled externally. One way to mitigate this issue is by restricting the file access to a specific directory or using a whitelist approach to only allow access to pre-defined files. Additionally, input sanitization and validation should be performed to prevent any unexpected behavior due to user input.
