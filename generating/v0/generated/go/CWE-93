Explanation of the vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the `FormValue` function used to retrieve form values from the HTTP request in the `item` variable. An attacker can craft a malicious request by injecting CRLF sequences (i.e., newline characters) within the `item` parameter value. This can be exploited to perform HTTP header injection attacks.

How it could be exploited:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the HTTP response headers, potentially setting cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or even injecting malicious scripts.

How to fix it:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation should be performed to sanitize the user input, specifically by removing or encoding newline characters and other special characters that could lead to HTTP header injection. One approach is to use a regular expression to validate and sanitize the input before processing it further. Also, using a robust web framework that handles input validation securely can help prevent CRLF injection attacks.
