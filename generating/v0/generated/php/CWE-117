Explanation of vulnerability:
In the code snippet provided, user input from the `$blogPost` variable is being directly written to a log file without proper sanitization or encoding. This can lead to a CWE-117 "Improper Output Neutralization for Logs" vulnerability. An attacker could potentially inject malicious content into the log file, which could be used for various nefarious purposes, such as injecting arbitrary log entries, performing log injection attacks, or manipulating log entries to hide their activities.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a blog post containing special characters or log injection payloads that would be interpreted by the logging system as legitimate log entries. This could lead to log forging, log injection, or even log injection attacks like log injection-based SQL injection or command injection attacks.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it's important to properly sanitize and validate user input before writing it to the log file. One way to mitigate this vulnerability is to use input validation functions or escaping mechanisms to sanitize the user input before logging it. For example, using PHP's `htmlspecialchars()` function to escape special characters or implementing a logging library that automatically sanitizes log entries. Additionally, limiting the types of characters allowed in the log file or restricting the length of the log entry can also help prevent log injection attacks.
