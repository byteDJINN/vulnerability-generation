|CODE|```

This code snippet is vulnerable to CWE-41 "Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence." The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `$file_path` variable used in `include()` directly incorporates user-provided input (`$_GET['file']`) without proper validation or sanitization.

Exploitation:
An attacker can manipulate the `file` parameter in the GET request to the PHP script to include arbitrary files outside of the intended directory. For example, an attacker could craft a request like `http://example.com/script.php?file=../../../etc/passwd`, which would include the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file on a Unix-based system.

Fix:
To prevent CWE-41 vulnerabilities, it's essential to validate and sanitize user input before using it to construct file paths. One way to mitigate the risk is to use a whitelist approach where only files within a specific directory are allowed to be included. For instance, you can check if the requested file is within the predefined directory before including it:

```php
<?php
$allowed_directory = '/var/www/html/uploads/';
$user_input = $_GET['file'];
$file_path = realpath($allowed_directory . $user_input);

if (strpos($file_path, $allowed_directory) === 0) {
    include($file_path);
} else {
    // Handle invalid file path
}
?>
```

By using `realpath()` to resolve the canonicalized path and ensuring that the requested file is within the allowed directory, you can prevent directory traversal attacks and mitigate the CWE-41 vulnerability.
