<?php
// Get user input for new item description
$itemDescription = $_POST['item_description'];

// Save item description to database
$query = "INSERT INTO items (description) VALUES ('$itemDescription')";
mysqli_query($conn, $query);

|CODE|```

Explanation:
In the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is in the way user input for the item description is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper validation. This can lead to a CRLF injection attack where an attacker could manipulate the input to insert additional SQL commands or modify the query's structure. 

Exploitation:
An attacker could craft a malicious input containing CRLF sequences (\r\n) and append additional SQL commands to the original query. For example, an attacker could input: `New item description\r\n; DROP TABLE items`. This would result in the insertion of the original item description followed by a second SQL command to delete the `items` table.

Fix:
To prevent CRLF injection attacks, user input should be properly sanitized and validated before being used in SQL queries. The recommended approach is to use prepared statements with parameterized queries or input validation functions to ensure that user input is treated as data and not executable code. By using prepared statements or input validation, the possibility of executing unintended SQL commands or altering the query's logic can be mitigated.
