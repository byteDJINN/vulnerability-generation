**Vulnerability Explanation:**
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to CWE-79, which is "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command". In this case, the user input ($_POST['dish']) is directly echoed back to the user without any sanitization or validation. This can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code or scripts as the value of 'dish' parameter.

**Exploitation:**
An attacker can craft a POST request and inject an HTML/JavaScript code as the value for 'dish' parameter. For example, if the attacker sets the 'dish' value to `<script>alert("XSS attack")</script>`, this script will be executed in the context of other users visiting the page, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

**Fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, user input should always be properly sanitized and validated before being used. In this case, you can mitigate the vulnerability by using input validation functions or encoding/escaping the output before displaying it to the user. For example, using htmlentities() function before echoing the value would encode the special characters making it safe to display. 

```php
<?php
$selectedDish = $_POST['dish'];
echo "Enjoy your selected dish: " . htmlentities($selectedDish);
?>
```
