|CODE|```

Explanation:
The code snippet provided contains the vulnerability CWE-120 "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')". In this scenario, the code uses the `strcpy` function to copy user input directly into a fixed-size buffer without verifying the size of the input against the buffer size. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the user input exceeds the allocated buffer size.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a maliciously long input that exceeds the size of the buffer allocated for `advice_buffer`. By doing so, the attacker could overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other security compromises.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it is crucial to ensure that the user input does not exceed the allocated buffer size before performing any buffer copy operations. One way to mitigate this issue is to use safer functions like `strncpy` that allow specifying the maximum number of characters to copy, preventing buffer overflows. Additionally, input validation and proper handling of user input lengths can help safeguard against buffer overflow attacks.
