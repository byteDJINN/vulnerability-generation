|CODE|```

In the code snippet provided, there is a vulnerability known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of input.

How the vulnerability works:
- The code takes user input from the URL query parameter `experience` using `$_GET['experience']`.
- This input is then directly echoed back to the webpage without any sanitization or validation.

How it could be exploited:
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL, such as `http://website.com/?experience=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which contains a malicious script.
- When a user visits this URL, the script gets executed in the context of the webpage, leading to XSS attacks. This can range from stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens) to defacing the website.

How to fix the vulnerability:
- Properly sanitize and validate user input before displaying it on the webpage. You can use functions like `htmlspecialchars()` to encode special characters and prevent script execution:
  
```php
<?php
$experience = $_GET['experience'];
echo "<p>" . htmlspecialchars($experience) . "</p>";
?>
```
- It's essential to validate and filter input against a set of rules to ensure that no malicious scripts are injected. Input validation can also be improved by allowing only whitelisted characters or patterns.
