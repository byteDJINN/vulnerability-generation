|CODE|```

Explanation:
The code snippet contains a vulnerability known as XML Injection, specifically Blind XPath Injection (CWE-91). In the code, user input from the `$_GET['country']` variable is directly concatenated into an XPath query without proper input validation or sanitization.

Exploitation:
An attacker can craft a malicious input value for the `country` parameter that alters the XPath query to retrieve unintended data or execute arbitrary commands on the server. For example, an attacker could input `" or "1"="1` as the `country` parameter value, which would make the XPath query always evaluate to true and return all stories from all countries, exposing sensitive information.

Fix:
To prevent XML Injection vulnerabilities, it is essential to sanitize and validate user input before directly using it in XML processing functions like SimpleXMLElement and XPath queries. One way to fix this vulnerability is to use whitelisting or strict input validation to only allow expected values for the `country` parameter. Additionally, consider using prepared statements if there is a need to construct dynamic XPath queries based on user input. By parameterizing inputs instead of concatenating them directly into the query, the vulnerability can be mitigated.
