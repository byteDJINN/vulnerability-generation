|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code snippet is the lack of proper neutralization of user-controlled input before logging it. In this case, the `blog_name` and `city_name` variables are directly used in the log message without any sanitization or validation.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input when calling the `log_travel_info` function. For example, the attacker could set `blog_name` to contain a newline character followed by arbitrary text, which could potentially lead to log injection attacks or log forging. In a real scenario, the attacker could use this to manipulate logs and mislead developers or analysts monitoring the application.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, it is important to properly sanitize and escape user input before including it in log messages. One way to mitigate this issue is by using a logging library that automatically sanitizes log messages or by manually escaping any user-controlled input before using it in logs. In this specific case, it would be advisable to sanitize `blog_name` and `city_name` variables before logging them, to prevent any malicious log injection attacks.
