# PowerShell code snippet with CWE-66 vulnerability
$filePath = "C:\Recipes\recipes.txt"
Get-Content $filePath

/*"""DELIMITER
```
|CODE|```

Explanation:
- In the provided code snippet, the variable `$filePath` contains a direct path to a file located on the local file system, which can be accessed using the `Get-Content` cmdlet.
- The vulnerability (CWE-66) arises from the fact that the code does not properly validate or sanitize the file path specified in the `$filePath` variable. This can allow an attacker to exploit the application by providing a malicious file path that leads to unauthorized access or unintended consequences.
- For example, an attacker could manipulate the file path to access sensitive system files or overwrite critical files on the system, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service attacks.

Fix:
- To mitigate the CWE-66 vulnerability, it is crucial to ensure that the file paths provided by users or within the application code are properly validated and sanitized.
- One way to address this vulnerability is to limit file access to a specific directory or only allow access to predefined file paths. Additionally, input validation checks should be implemented to prevent malicious manipulation of the file paths.
- It is recommended to use built-in security features and functions provided by the programming language or framework to securely handle file paths and prevent unauthorized access to system resources.
