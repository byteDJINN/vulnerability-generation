# Welcome to our Virtual Vintage Marketplace!

$listingName = Read-Host "Enter the name of the antique item you want to list:"

# Assume the user is adding a new listing to the marketplace

### Vulnerability Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code snippet above is CWE-93, also known as "CRLF Injection". In this scenario, the user input for `$listingName` is directly concatenated into the `$listingDescription` variable without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject newline characters (CRLF - Carriage Return Line Feed) into the description.

### Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a malicious payload along with the intended item name. For example, by inputting `MaliciousItem%nAttackerPayload` as the item name, an attacker could inject a newline character followed by their payload, such as creating a fake listing, inserting malicious links, or altering the content of the CSV file in unexpected ways.

### How to Fix:
To mitigate the CRLF Injection vulnerability, it is essential to properly validate and sanitize user input. In this case, one way to fix the vulnerability would be to sanitize the input to remove any newline characters before concatenating it into the description. Additionally, it's recommended to use parameterized queries or encoding techniques to prevent malicious input from being interpreted incorrectly.
