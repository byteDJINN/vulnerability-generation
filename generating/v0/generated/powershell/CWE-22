Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code snippet provided is known as Path Traversal (CWE-22). In this case, the code concatenates a user-provided file name with a base directory path to construct a file path for reading the file content. An attacker can manipulate the user input to traverse outside the intended directory (`C:\collaboration\uploads\`) and access sensitive system files or directories.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing input like `..\..\Windows\System32\config\` as the file name. When appended to the base path, this input would result in the path `C:\collaboration\uploads\..\..\Windows\System32\config\`, allowing the attacker to read sensitive system configuration files.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented to ensure that the user input is within the boundaries of the intended directory. You can use regex to ensure that the user input does not contain any `..\` sequences or any characters that could allow path traversal. Additionally, consider using absolute file paths instead of concatenating user input with a base path to minimize the risk of path traversal vulnerabilities.
