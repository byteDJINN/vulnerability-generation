### Vulnerability Explanation:
The code snippet provided is vulnerable to LDAP Injection (CWE-90). In this case, the variables `$userId` and `$customization` are directly concatenated into an LDAP query filter without proper input validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious input that alters the intended LDAP query behavior, potentially allowing them to retrieve unauthorized data or perform other nefarious actions.

### Exploitation Example:
An attacker could input a customized value like `*)(cn=*)(objectClass=user` resulting in a malicious LDAP filter that retrieves all user objects in the LDAP directory, bypassing any access controls or restrictions.

### Fix:
To mitigate LDAP Injection vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or properly escape special characters in user input. In this scenario, validating and sanitizing user input before constructing the LDAP query can help prevent unauthorized manipulation of the query structure. It's crucial to ensure that user inputs are properly validated and encoded according to the LDAP syntax rules.
