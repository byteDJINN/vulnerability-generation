|CODE|```

In this code snippet, we have a TypeScript interface `LaundryRequest` that represents a request for laundry service. It contains a `userId` field and an array of `laundryItems`.

**Vulnerability (CWE-112 - Missing XML Validation):**
The vulnerability in this code lies in the lack of input validation. The `LaundryRequest` interface does not enforce any strict validation rules on the input data. This can potentially lead to XML-related vulnerabilities if the input data is parsed or manipulated in an insecure manner.

**Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious XML payloads that could potentially lead to XML injection attacks. For example, an attacker could inject XML entities, which may result in information leakage, denial of service, or other security issues depending on how the data is processed.

**Fix:**
To fix this vulnerability, it is recommended to perform proper input validation by implementing XML validation checks on the input data. This can be done by using libraries like `xmldom` or built-in XML parsers depending on the specific requirements of the application. Additionally, sanitizing and validating the input data before processing it is crucial to prevent XML-related vulnerabilities.
