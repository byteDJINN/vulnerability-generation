|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting" occurs when the application allows an external entity (user or attacker) to specify the value of a system or configuration setting. In the code snippet provided, the API key is being read from an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`, which could be controlled externally.

Exploitation:
An attacker could directly set the `API_KEY` environment variable to a malicious value before running the application. By doing so, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources associated with the API key.

Mitigation:
To address this vulnerability, it is essential to not rely solely on environment variables for sensitive information like API keys. Instead, consider using a secure secret management service such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault to store and retrieve sensitive configuration values. This approach helps in better protecting the secrets and preventing external control of system or configuration settings.
