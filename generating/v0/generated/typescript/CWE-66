### Vulnerability Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code snippet is the improper handling of the `recipeFilename` variable to construct a file path for reading the recipe file. Specifically, the code directly concatenates the `recipeFilename` variable with the `/recipes/` path without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to path traversal attacks where an attacker manipulates the `recipeFilename` to access files outside the intended directory (`/recipes/`).

### Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious `recipeFilename` that contains `../` sequences to traverse directories and potentially access sensitive files on the server. For example, if an attacker sets `recipeFilename` to `../../../../../etc/passwd`, they may be able to read the server's password file.

### Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented to ensure that the `recipeFilename` variable does not contain any path traversal sequences. One way to mitigate this vulnerability is by using a whitelist approach to restrict the `recipeFilename` to only known recipe file names. Additionally, using a safe file access mechanism that does not rely on user-controlled input for constructing file paths, such as storing recipes in a database instead of directly accessing files, can also help prevent path traversal attacks.
