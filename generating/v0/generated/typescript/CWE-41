|CODE|```

In the code snippet provided, the vulnerability CWE-41 "Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence" is present. This vulnerability occurs when the application does not properly handle the normalization of file paths, allowing for path traversal or directory traversal attacks.

In this scenario, the `getGiftImage` function takes a giftId as input and constructs a file path by joining the `/images/gifts/` directory with the provided giftId using the `path.join` method. However, since the giftId parameter is directly concatenated into the path without proper validation or sanitization, an attacker can exploit this by providing a malicious giftId like '../..//../../../etc/passwd'. This input results in the path traversal attack, attempting to access sensitive files on the server such as the '/etc/passwd' file.

To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be implemented to prevent path traversal attacks. One approach is to validate the giftId input to ensure it only contains valid characters (alphanumeric characters, for example) and does not contain any directory traversal sequences like '../'. Additionally, utilize a safe method to construct file paths or consider using a whitelist of allowed giftIds to further limit possible attacks.
