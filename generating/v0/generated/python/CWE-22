|CODE|```

**Vulnerability Explanation:** 
The code snippet contains a `Path Traversal` vulnerability (CWE-22) where the file path is directly constructed using the `file_name` variable without proper validation. An attacker could manipulate the file path by providing '../' to traverse directories and access files outside the intended directory.

**Exploitation:** 
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted `file_name` like `../secrets/passwords.txt` to navigate to a sensitive file outside the intended directory and read its contents, exposing potentially confidential information.

**Fix:**
To prevent `Path Traversal` vulnerabilities, it is important to validate and sanitize user input. In this case, before constructing the `file_path`, you should ensure that the `file_name` doesn't contain any directory traversal characters like '../'. One way to fix this vulnerability is by validating the `file_name` input against a list of allowed characters or using a whitelist approach to restrict access to specific directories.
