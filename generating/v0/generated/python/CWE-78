|CODE|```

Explanation:
The provided code snippet is vulnerable to OS Command Injection (CWE-78) due to the direct concatenation of user-controlled input into the OS command without proper sanitization. In this case, the user input is directly passed to the `os.system` function without any validation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by inputting malicious commands along with their funny moments, leading to arbitrary command execution on the underlying operating system.

For example, if an attacker provides the input: `; rm -rf /`, the resultant command executed would be:
```
os.system("echo ''; rm -rf / >> moments.txt")
```
This would not only write the innocent 10-second moment to the `moments.txt` file but also execute the malicious command to delete all the files in the root directory.

To fix the vulnerability, the input should be sanitized or validated before being used in the OS command. One way to mitigate this issue is by using parameterized queries or escaping user input when calling the OS command. For Python, the `subprocess` module with `subprocess.Popen` or `subprocess.run` along with proper argument passing can be a safer alternative to `os.system`. By strictly filtering and validating user input, we can prevent unauthorized command execution.
