|CODE|```

Explanation of the vulnerability (CWE-93 â€“ Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ('CRLF Injection') - HTTP Response Splitting):
- In the code snippet above, the vulnerability lies in the form's action attribute where the user input for the search term could potentially include newline characters such as "\n" or "\r\n".
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting CRLF characters into the search term input field. For example, if an attacker inputs something like `malicious%0D%0AContent-Length:%200%0D%0A%0D%0AHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK`, it could result in a new HTTP Response splitting attack.
- The attacker may inject malicious content into the response header that is sent back to the client, leading to various attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), defacement, data theft, etc.

How to fix the vulnerability:
- Proper input validation should be implemented to filter out and reject any CRLF characters in user inputs.
- Sanitize user inputs by escaping or removing any newline characters before processing the input data.
- In the specific HTML form in this example, server-side code should be used to sanitize and validate the search term input to ensure it does not contain any CRLF characters before processing the search query.
