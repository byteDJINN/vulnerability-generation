### Description:
The provided code snippet is a simple C program for a virtual marketplace where users can view items by entering the item name. The vulnerability lies in the `fgets` function, which reads user input into the `itemName` buffer. If an attacker enters a malicious input containing CRLF sequences (Carriage Return & Line Feed), it can inject additional content after the entered item name.

### Exploitation:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting CRLF sequences to insert harmful content, such as injecting new HTTP headers or injecting malicious scripts that get executed when rendered on a webpage. For example, an attacker could inject a fake item listing, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions.

### Fix:
To fix this vulnerability and prevent CRLF injection, you should sanitize user input to remove any unwanted characters like CR and LF. One way to address this is to loop through the input and replace any instances of '\r' and '\n' with spaces or simply remove them. Additionally, consider using more secure input functions like `scanf` or `fgets` with stricter input validation to prevent such injection attacks.
