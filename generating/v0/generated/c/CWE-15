|CODE|```

Explanation:
The code snippet contains a vulnerability known as CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting". In this snippet, the program takes user input for a file name and directly passes it to the `system()` function without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by providing a malicious filename.

Exploitation:
An attacker can provide a malicious command as the input filename, such as "; rm -rf /", which would result in the deletion of critical files on the system.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, input validation and sanitization should be performed before using user-supplied data in system calls. One way to mitigate this issue is to restrict the user input to a predefined list of allowed values or sanitize the input to remove any special characters that could modify the command's behavior. As an alternative, consider using specific file I/O functions for file manipulation instead of executing system commands based on user input.
