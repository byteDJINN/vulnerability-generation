Explanation:
In this code snippet, there is a vulnerability known as Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following'). The program takes user input for the name of the pet file without verifying or properly sanitizing it. As a result, an attacker could manipulate the input to access arbitrary files on the system, potentially disclosing sensitive information or modifying system files.

Exploitation:
An attacker could enter "../../../../../etc/passwd" as the input, which would traverse up the directory structure and attempt to open the system password file. If the program runs under elevated privileges, the attacker could access this sensitive file.

Fix:
To fix this vulnerability, always ensure that user input is validated and sanitized before using it to access files. One way to mitigate this issue is to restrict the file path based on a whitelist of allowed characters or directories. Additionally, use functions like `realpath()` to resolve the full path of the file and verify its location before accessing it.
