|CODE|```
Explanation:
The vulnerability in this code snippet lies in the improper resolution of the file path. The `snprintf` function is used to concatenate the directory path with the user input file name to create a path to open a file. However, this vulnerability could potentially be exploited by an attacker by providing a file name with `../` or similar sequences to traverse out of the intended directory and access files outside of `/home/artisans/`.

To fix this issue, it is important to properly validate and sanitize user input. One way to mitigate this vulnerability is by checking if the provided file name contains any unauthorized path traversal characters such as `../` before constructing the path. Additionally, it is recommended to use absolute file paths instead of concatenated paths to avoid path traversal vulnerabilities.
