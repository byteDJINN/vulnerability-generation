|CODE|```

Explanation:
The vulnerability in this code snippet is a SQL Injection vulnerability. In the `postSecret` method, the secret provided by a user is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious secret containing SQL commands, which would be directly executed by the database.

For example, an attacker could input the following secret:
```
'; DROP TABLE secrets; --
```
The resulting SQL query would become:
```
INSERT INTO secrets (content) VALUES (''; DROP TABLE secrets; --')
```
This would cause the `secrets` table to be dropped from the database due to the injected SQL command.

To fix this vulnerability, it is important to use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database. By using parameterized queries, input values are treated as data and not as executable SQL code, preventing SQL injection attacks. Here is an example of how the code snippet could be fixed:

```
public class SecretService {
    public void postSecret(String secret) {
        String query = "INSERT INTO secrets (content) VALUES (?)";
        try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
            statement.setString(1, secret);
            statement.executeUpdate();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            // Handle the exception
        }
    }
}
```
