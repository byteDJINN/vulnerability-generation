Explanation of the vulnerability (CWE-112 - Missing XML Validation):
The vulnerability in this code snippet is the lack of XML validation before processing the data. The code directly parses the XML data without any validation checks in place, making it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious XML payload that includes external entities pointing to sensitive system files or resources. This could lead to unauthorized data access, server-side request forgery, or remote code execution.

How the vulnerability could be exploited:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious XML payload like the following:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE laundryRequest [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<laundryRequest>
  <customerName>John</customerName>
  <items>&xxe;</items>
</laundryRequest>
```
If the application processes this XML payload without validation, it would include the contents of the "/etc/passwd" file in the output, potentially exposing sensitive system information.

How to fix the vulnerability:
To fix the vulnerability, it is important to validate and sanitize the incoming XML data before processing it. One approach is to disable external entity processing in the XML parser by setting the `FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature and enable certain secure processing options. Additionally, consider using a whitelist approach to only allow expected XML elements and attributes, preventing unexpected entities from being processed. It is crucial to follow secure coding practices and incorporate input validation and output encoding to mitigate XML-related vulnerabilities.
