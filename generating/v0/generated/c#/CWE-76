### Vulnerability Explanation:
The code snippet shown above is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of user input. In this case, the user input is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious scripts to be injected into the application.

### How it could be exploited:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering malicious script tags or payloads as input, such as `<script>alert('Vulnerable to XSS');</script>`. When this input is displayed back to other users of the website without proper encoding, the script will be executed in their browsers, leading to potential theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

### How to fix it:
To fix this vulnerability, user input should be properly sanitized and encoded before being displayed to the users. In this case, using `HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` function to encode the user input before displaying it would prevent the execution of malicious scripts and protect the application from XSS attacks.
