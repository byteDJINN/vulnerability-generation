|CODE|```

Explanation:
The code snippet provided contains the vulnerability CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting". In the `CreateGarden` method of the `GardenService` class, the `gardenName` parameter is directly used to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the `gardenName` input and potentially write files to unintended locations on the system.

Exploitation:
An attacker could provide a malicious input such as "../../../Windows/System32/evil.txt" as the `gardenName` when prompted by the program. This input constructs a path outside of the intended directory and writes a file "evil.txt" into the System32 directory, potentially causing harm to the system.

Fix:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to validate and sanitize user inputs, especially when constructing file paths or interacting with system resources. In this case, you can normalize the input path using `Path.GetFullPath` method to ensure it doesn't navigate outside of the intended directory. Below is an updated version of the `CreateGarden` method with path normalization:

```csharp
public void CreateGarden(string gardenName)
{
    string fileName = $"{gardenName}.txt";
    string path = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine("C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents", fileName));
    if (!path.StartsWith("C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\"))
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("Invalid garden name");
    }
    
    File.WriteAllText(path, "Welcome to your garden!");
}
```

With this change, the program checks that the constructed file path is within the intended directory before writing the file, preventing directory traversal attacks.
