|CODE|```

The vulnerability CWE-59 "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')" is present in the code snippet above. The issue arises when user-provided input (`petName`) is directly used to construct a file path without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious input that includes directory traversal sequences or arbitrary file paths to access sensitive files on the system.

For example, an attacker could input "../Windows/System32/config/system" as the `petName`, causing the application to try to read the sensitive system file "system" located in the Windows System32 directory.

To fix this vulnerability, it is important to validate and sanitize user input before using it to access files. One way to mitigate this issue is to restrict user input to only valid characters, prevent directory traversal sequences, and use a safe file access method that doesn't allow arbitrary file path manipulation. You can also use a whitelist approach to ensure that the input adheres to a specific format or pattern and avoid dynamic construction of file paths based on user input.
