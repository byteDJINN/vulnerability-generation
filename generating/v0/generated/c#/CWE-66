Explanation:
The vulnerability in the code snippet is due to the improper handling of file names that identify virtual resources. In this case, the code constructs a file path using user input (the `cityName` variable) without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious input for `cityName` to access files outside the intended directory (`/recipes/` in this case).

For example, an attacker could input `../web.config` as the `cityName`, which would result in the file path `/recipes/../web.config` being used. This could allow an attacker to read sensitive system files or execute malicious code.

To fix this vulnerability, it is important to validate and sanitize user input before constructing file paths. One approach is to restrict the input to known valid values (e.g., a predefined list of cities). Additionally, input validation checks should be performed to ensure that the constructed file path stays within the intended directory. It is also recommended to use secure APIs for handling file operations and to avoid directly concatenating user input to file paths.
