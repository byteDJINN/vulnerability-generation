Explanation:
The code snippet provided above is vulnerable to CWE-73, which is "External Control of File Name or Path". In this snippet, the `fileName` variable is directly taken from user input without any validation or sanitization, and then used to construct a file path where data will be written to. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious `fileName` that points to a sensitive system file, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or other security risks.

To fix this vulnerability, do not directly use user-provided input to construct file paths. Instead, ensure that user input is properly validated, sanitized, and restricted to a safe scope of allowed values. Implement strict input validation and avoid using user input directly in file paths.
