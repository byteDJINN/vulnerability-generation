Explanation:
The vulnerability CWE-59 "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')" occurs when the code accesses a file using a path or filename that is controlled by an attacker, allowing the attacker to traverse the file system and potentially access sensitive files.

In this code snippet, the `filename` variable is directly used to read the contents of a file using `fs.readFile` without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the `filename` variable to access files outside of the intended directory or read sensitive system files.

Exploitation:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `filename` variable to access files such as `/etc/passwd` (on Unix systems) containing sensitive information like user credentials.

Fix:
To fix the vulnerability, it is crucial to validate and sanitize user input before using it to access files. One way to mitigate this issue is to restrict file access to a specific directory and avoid using user-controlled input directly in file paths. Additionally, implementing proper input validation and file access controls can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files.
