|CODE|```

Explanation:
This code snippet is attempting to sanitize user input by replacing any occurrences of the less-than symbol '<' with the HTML entity '&lt;'. However, this method is not sufficient to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability (CWE-76) is known as "Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements," where the code fails to properly neutralize special elements that can be misinterpreted by the browser.

Exploitation:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting a script containing malicious code disguised as HTML tags. Since the code snippet only replaces '<' with '&lt;', an attacker can easily bypass this by using different encoding or simply using attributes such as 'onerror' or 'javascript:' to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

Fix:
To properly mitigate the CWE-76 vulnerability and prevent XSS attacks, it is recommended to use a secure method such as the Content Security Policy (CSP) header, which defines trusted sources of content that the browser can load. Sanitizing inputs using well-tested libraries like DOMPurify or implementing contextual output encoding based on the location where the data is being inserted can also help prevent XSS attacks.
